Genesis Design System | Release Note - v1.0.0 :seedling:
We are thrilled to announce the release of Genesis Design System (GenDS) - the foundational UI component library built on Genesis Design System! This marks a significant milestone in creating consistent, accessible, and beautiful user experiences across the Impetus ecosystem. 

## The Need for GenDS
At Impetus, we've been creating powerful UIs for years, but without a formal design system, our interfaces often varied in style, components, and user experience. This inconsistency made our UIs fall short of the high-quality designs created in Figma. GenDS is our solution to bridge this gap - creating a unified design language that ensures pixel-perfect implementation of designs across all our products.

## What's Included
Public documentation : Genesis Storybook Documentation
Gneds MCP Server: https://context7.com/ryadav96/gends
Tech Stack: React 18, Radix UI , Tailwind CSS , Shadcn

:rocket: AI First Approach:
AI-POWERED Integration workflow with Cursor IDE.
INTELLIGENT GenDS documentation integration in AI IDE via MCP Server & Context7

We used Cursor IDE for the development of the component, including:
Component Scaffolding
Storybook Documentation
Unit Test Case Generation

### AI + Design System Integration Demo
We've pioneered a seamless workflow combining Cursor IDE with our Storybook MCP integration. This allows developers to access GenDS documentation and component details directly within their coding environment, dramatically reducing context switching and accelerating development. Our recorded demo showcases how developers can effortlessly query component APIs, view examples, and implement components without leaving their editor.

### Why Tailwind CSS?
We chose Tailwind CSS as our styling foundation for several key reasons:
- **Developer Velocity**: Utility-first approach drastically speeds up UI implementation
- **Consistency**: Predefined design tokens ensure uniform spacing, sizing, and colors
- **Lightweight**: Purging unused styles creates minimal production bundles
- **Flexibility**: Easy to extend and customize while maintaining design system constraints
- **Ecosystem**: Rich plugin ecosystem and excellent browser devtools integration

### AI-Powered Development
Our component development process leveraged AI in multiple ways:
- **Component Structure**: Using AI to scaffold initial component architecture based on design patterns
- **Test Generation**: Automatically generating comprehensive test suites based on component specifications
- **Documentation**: Creating detailed API documentation and usage examples
- **Accessibility**: Identifying and resolving potential accessibility issues during development
- **Edge Cases**: Analyzing components for potential edge cases and failure modes
